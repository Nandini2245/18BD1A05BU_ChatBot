Using Dialogflow, a simple user interactive chatbot is created. 
Technologies used: node js, mongoDB, google dialogflow

Project Description:
User name is identified, i.e retrieved from data base based on the account number given by the user. 
Later the user is asked about the trouble he is facing. Accordingly, the chatbot responds with a 
user name and status of the issued problem, along with a generated trouble_token.
